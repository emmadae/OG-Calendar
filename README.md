# OG-Calendar

## POGO
POGO is an organizational calendar designed to be an all-in-one stop for the everyday person. This app consists of multiple widgets including a calendar used to add and delete events, meetings, etc. to keep an organized day to day of your life. It also consists of an email widget, Meetups and Groupon information, time, local weather, ect. Instead of using multiple apps and websites to gather information which can take time and be tiresome, use POGO as your all in one stop to a well organized future!

## Usage
This app is still in the development stages. POGO is designed with the user in mind. To begin, you will be directed to a home page. The home page consists of a basic Google login system. After logging in you will be directed to a page where you are able to connect your personal social media connections such as facebook, twitter, etc. Using the Watson API, we are able to pull your personal information and create a basic profile for the user that will then connect to the actual app itself. You will then be directed to the main page. Here you will see your user information, the calendar, email widget, weather, time, groupon information, meetup information, and more. The information that was pulled prior will be applied to widgets such as Meetup and Groupon where you will receive recommendations based on your Watson Profile.

## Further Development
Further development could include a more user friendly system where the user is able to add and delete widgets from a predefined (wide range) list of applications to incorporate into your POGO app. Instead of having a hardcoded set list, you will be able to add and remove widgets based on your wants and needs! Another future development would be a more interactive calendar that sends alerts to your phone when you have a meeting or event, and much more!
